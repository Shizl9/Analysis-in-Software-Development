Analysis Phase in Software Development 

Definition & Importance: 
The Analysis Phase is a critical step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements for a software system. It ensures the development team fully understands the needs of stakeholders and lays the foundation for system design and implementation. 

Sub-Steps: 

Requirement Gathering: Collect functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders. 

System Analysis: Analyze the current system (if any) and identify gaps. 

Feasibility Study: Assess technical, operational, and financial feasibility. 

Solution Design Alternatives: Evaluate possible solutions and select the best approach. 

Modeling & Documentation: Create data models, process flow diagrams, and SRS (Software Requirements Specification). 

Deliverables / Outcomes: 

Requirement Specifications Document (SRS) 

Data Models & Flowcharts 

Feasibility Reports 

List of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements 

Best Practices: 

Engage stakeholders continuously 

Verify requirements for clarity and completeness 

Maintain proper documentation 

Common Challenges: 

Ambiguous or incomplete requirements 

Frequent changes during analysis 

Miscommunication between developers and stakeholders
