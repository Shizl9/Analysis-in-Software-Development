# Hospital Management System

---

## 1. Analysis Phase

### Definition and Importance
The Analysis Phase is the stage in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where all requirements of the hospital system are collected, analyzed, and clearly understood before design and development begin.

**Importance:**
1. Reduces errors caused by misunderstanding hospital requirements.
2. Ensures all stakeholders are satisfied: doctors, nurses, admin staff, and patients.
3. Provides a clear foundation for development (User Stories, Product Backlog).

### Sub-steps

1. **Requirements Elicitation** – Gathering requirements from doctors, nurses, receptionists, lab and pharmacy staff.  
2. **Requirements Analysis** – Organize functional and non-functional requirements.  
3. **Requirements Specification** – Document requirements as User Stories and diagrams.  
4. **Validation & Approval** – Review and confirm requirements with stakeholders.

### Deliverables / Outcomes
- Documented Requirements (User Stories)  
- Use Case Diagrams / ERD  
- Preliminary Product Backlog

## 2. Product Backlog / User Stories

| ID   | User Story | Story Points | Acceptance Criteria |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| US01 | As a receptionist, I want to register a new patient so that their medical information can be tracked. | 5 | Patient info stored correctly, unique patient ID generated. |
| US02 | As a patient, I want to book an appointment with a doctor so that I can receive medical care. | 3 | Appointment confirmed, notification sent to doctor. |
| US03 | As a doctor, I want to view patient medical records so that I can provide accurate treatment. | 5 | Medical history, medications, lab results are available. |
| US04 | As a lab staff, I want to record test results so that doctors can access them. | 3 | Test results saved correctly and linked to patient. |
| US05 | As a pharmacist, I want to dispense medicines according to prescriptions so that patients receive correct medications. | 3 | Inventory updated and record saved. |
| US06 | As an accountant, I want to generate bills after medical services so that payments can be collected. | 5 | Accurate invoices generated, insurance linked if applicable. |
| US07 | As a hospital manager, I want to see hospital statistics so that I can monitor performance. | 5 | Dashboard shows patients, inventory, revenue correctly. |
| US08 | As a receptionist, I want to send appointment reminders to patients so that they do not miss appointments. | 3 | Notifications sent on time. |
| US09 | As an IT admin, I want to manage user roles and permissions so that only authorized staff can access data. | 5 | Roles enforced, users see only allowed sections. |
| US10 | As a patient, I want to view my lab test results online so that I can track my health. | 3 | Results available securely online. |
